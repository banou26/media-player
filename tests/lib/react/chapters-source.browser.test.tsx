 * chapter list proves nothing about a real file. `chapters.mkv` carries three deliberately unequal
 * chapters, and libav reports their bounds in SECONDS.
 *
 * The last chapter ends at 20 while the file runs to 20.023, which is asserted rather than tidied
 * away: chapters are not obliged to tile the duration and the seekbar has to cope with the tail.
