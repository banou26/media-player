 * The chrome does not hide itself out from under a pointer that is resting on a control.

 * The hide is a timeout on the last MOVEMENT, so aiming at a small control and pausing for three
 * seconds used to run it out and take the control away under the cursor. Everything then falls
 * through to the picture, which is measurable rather than cosmetic: `elementFromPoint` at the
 * button's own centre returns the `video`, so a click pauses playback instead of pressing the
 * button, and a right click offers the browser's video menu rather than the link's. That is how a
 * link an app draws in the overlay stops behaving like a link.
 *
 * Two arms, and the second is the one that keeps the first honest: resting on the PICTURE must still
 * hide, or "never hides" would pass this too.
