/**
 * The spike: a real video, in another document, driven only by messages.
 *
 * Every other remote test here hands the player an object in its own realm, so the transport is a
 * function call and the hard part never happens. The hard part is that `Media` is synchronous while
 * a cross-document transport is not, and the whole design rests on the claim that a locally-held
 * mirror bridges the two well enough for the chrome to be usable. This is where that claim is
 * either true or it is not.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches into the frame. The player is given the mirror, the mirror only posts
 * messages, and the assertions read the far side's own reported state.
