/**
 * A media element that has failed is rebuilt, not reported.
 *
 * `MediaError` is terminal: the decoder is finished and every `appendBuffer` after it throws, so a
 * player that only reports the error is a dead rectangle until the viewer reloads the page. Firefox
 * reaches that state on its own over a slow source: when the source buffer runs dry it drains the
 * decoder so the frames still inside it get shown, clearing that drain needs a decoded sample to
 * resume from, and a seek into an empty buffer has none. Every packet after that comes back
 * `avcodec_send_packet error: End of file`. Reproduced twice against the live ripple deploy on
 * 2026-08-11, at which point playback was over for good.
 *
 * The failure is injected here rather than provoked, because provoking it needs a slow source and a
 * particular engine, and what has to be pinned is the RESPONSE: a new MediaSource every time,
 * nothing shown to the viewer, and a count kept so the session is still reportable afterwards.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO ceiling on the rebuilds. A viewer forty minutes into an episode is not
 * helped by a budget running out on a fault that is not the file's, so the guard against a source
 * that fails deterministically is the backoff plus the visible record, not a refusal to try.
