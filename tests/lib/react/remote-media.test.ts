/**
 * A media the player drives but does not own has to satisfy video.js's own gates, not ours.
 *
 * These are the real predicates the store runs, and they decide silently: `playbackFeature.attach`
 * returns early unless the media is pause AND seek AND source capable, and `timeFeature.seek` does
 * nothing without seek and source. A media that misses one does not throw, it produces a chrome that
 * renders and never responds, which is the hardest possible thing to diagnose from a screenshot. So
 * the point of this file is that the shape we publish keeps clearing them.
 *
 * Written against the real `@videojs/media` on purpose. A hand-written copy of the predicates would
 * pass forever and prove nothing about the betas we actually run.
