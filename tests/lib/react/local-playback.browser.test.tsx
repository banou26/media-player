/**
 * The local arm, end to end, on a real file.
 *
 * Every other browser test here drives a media the player does not own, which deliberately runs none
 * of the pipeline: no libav, no MediaSource, no jassub. This one runs all of it, because that is the
 * half a refactor of the store can break without any type complaining. It is what proves that the
 * engine still discovers tracks, that they arrive under the renamed store fields, and that a first
 * segment reaches the element.
 *
 * The fixture is synthesized by `scripts/fixture.mjs` rather than committed, so this skips with a
 * readable reason rather than failing when it has not been generated.
