/**
 * A tooltip does not survive the control moving out from under a pointer that never moved.
 *
 * Clicking full screen relays the whole chrome out from under a stationary pointer, and the browser
 * recomputes the hover chain for that SILENTLY: the `:hover` flag flips a frame later, so the grey
 * pill corrects itself in about 14ms, but no boundary event is dispatched at all. Measured across
 * the transition, the anchor receives zero mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter or mouseleave, only
 * `fullscreenchange`. react-tooltip closes on `mouseout` and on nothing else, so it never learns the
 * pointer left, and the chip stays painted for the rest of the session: it survives arbitrary later
 * pointer movement, because the browser has already updated its own element-under-pointer, and it
 * survives the chrome's own auto-hide, coming back the instant the controls wake.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the rule TooltipDisplay applies, which is deterministic and needs no real
 * fullscreen: on a fullscreen transition, close the chip unless the pointer is genuinely still
 * inside the anchor. The two cases are the whole claim, and the second is what stops the fix from
 * being "close on every transition": a player that already fills the window moves nothing, and the
 * tooltip under the pointer is then legitimately open.
