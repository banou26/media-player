/**
 * How big a subtitle comes out, measured against libass itself.
 *
 * `public/subtitle-scale.mkv` carries an ASS track authored for 720p on a 1080p picture, which is
 * what most releases ship: libass has to scale the script up, and the events name a style rather
 * than inherit one. Eight capital H's in Liberation Sans, the face jassub's own `default.woff2`
 * carries, so the browser and the reference below draw the same outlines.
 *
 * The reference is ffmpeg's own libass on that same track, which makes this a comparison between two
 * libass builds rather than a guess about font metrics:
 *
 *   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=black:size=1920x1080 \
 *          -vf "ass=subtitle-scale.ass,bbox=min_val=16" -frames:v 1 -f null -
 *   -> w:344 h:48   (230x32 at 1280x720 and 688x94 at 3840x2160: linear in the frame height)
 *
 * What this catches, and nothing else in the suite does: the player handing libass a style NAME
 * where libass wants a style INDEX. That renders every line in libass's own built-in default, Arial
 * at size 18, so the picture still has subtitles on it and only their size, weight and position are
 * wrong. Measured before the fix: 143x24 where libass draws 344x48.
