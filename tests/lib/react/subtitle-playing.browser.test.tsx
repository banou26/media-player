/**
 * Subtitles follow the playhead while the video is actually PLAYING.
 *
 * This is the one thing jassub 2 does entirely by itself, and until this file nothing in the suite
 * touched it. Every other subtitle test measures a paused player, because the `autoplay` prop is
 * inert in this rig: an unmuted `play()` is rejected with `NotAllowedError`, so the element sits at
 * time zero and the renderer's own repaints put the first line on screen. Drop `video` from the
 * JASSUB constructor, or let its `requestVideoFrameCallback` loop regress, and the picture freezes on
 * whatever was last drawn while every one of those tests stays green.
 *
 * Muting is what makes playback possible here, and it costs nothing: `muted` is output only, so
 * `currentTime`, the decode path and everything measured below are identical either way.
 *
 * `subtitle-seek.mkv` is the fixture because its only line ends at 2.5s of a 6s picture, so simply
 * letting it play past that point has to take the line off the screen.
