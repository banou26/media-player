/**
 * Subtitles keep up with the track while the video is PAUSED.
 *
 * jassub 1 was driven by a 100ms `setCurrentTime` tick from this repo, which redrew unconditionally
 * whatever the element was doing. jassub 2 removed `setCurrentTime`, `setRate` and `onDemandRender`
 * outright and draws only from `requestVideoFrameCallback`, so a paused element presents no frames
 * and NOTHING repaints on its own. Every path that changes what libass would draw has to ask for a
 * frame itself.
 *
 * Turning subtitles off while paused is the cheapest thing that proves it: no frame is presented, so
 * the only way the line can leave the picture is the renderer asking for one. Without that ask the
 * viewer turns subtitles off, watches the line stay on screen, and gets it removed whenever they
 * happen to press play.
 *
 * It doubles as the answer to a question that could not be settled by reading the wasm: whether
 * `rawRender` after a `freeTrack` yields an empty list (which clears the surface) or null (which
 * makes `_draw` return early and leaves the last frame up forever).
