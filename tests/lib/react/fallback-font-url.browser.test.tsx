/**
 * A relative `defaultFontUrl` has to reach the worker as something it can actually fetch.
 *
 * The worker fetches the fallback font itself, and a relative url handed straight to it resolves
 * against the WORKER's url rather than the document's. libass is then left with no face to draw with
 * and the track renders NOTHING: no error, no warning, just a picture with no subtitles on it. The
 * app never hit this because `asset-urls.ts` hands over urls the bundler emitted, but the option is
 * public API and "my-font.woff2" is the obvious thing for a consumer to pass. `workerFetched` in
 * `subtitles.ts` is what resolves it against the document first.
 *
 * Measured before the fix: nothing painted at all. After: the same ink as the absolute url.
 *
 * Under jassub 1 the worker was built from a `blob:` url, which made the mismatch dramatic. jassub 2
 * loads a real module url from this origin, so a ROOT-relative path would now resolve by accident and
 * prove nothing. Hence the leading slash is stripped below: a path-relative url is the one that still
 * resolves differently for the worker than for the document, and it is the case worth pinning.
 *
 * The face is checked as well as the fact of painting, because a font that failed to load and one
 * that loaded both leave a canvas behind; only the size tells them apart. The reference is ffmpeg's
 * own libass on this fixture, as in `subtitle-scale.browser.test.tsx`.
