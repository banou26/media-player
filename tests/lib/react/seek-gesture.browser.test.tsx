/**
 * A click on the seek bar must not move the playhead until its data is ready.
 *
 * This is the regression test for a fault that reached production. Seeking only once the target has
 * data is what stops firefox wedging its decoder, and the first version of that decided what was a
 * drag from the gap between calls. `useDragValue` reports a change on the PRESS and again on every
 * pointermove, so an ordinary click that drifts a single pixel produced two calls milliseconds
 * apart, the second was read as a drag, and the playhead jumped onto unbuffered ground before its
 * data existed. A perfectly still click was protected; a real mouse never is.
 *
 * So what is pinned here is the ORDER, which is deterministic and needs no unbuffered ground to
 * demonstrate: the press moves nothing, and the release is what seeks.
