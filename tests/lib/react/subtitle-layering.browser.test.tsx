/**
 * Subtitles paint under the title, the spinner and the error text, and over the picture.
 *
 * They used to, for free: the subtitle surface was a `<canvas>` and picked up chrome.tsx's
 * `canvas { z-index: 1 }`. The jassub 2 migration made it a `<div class="subtitles">`, which is
 * matched by `& > div:not(:last-of-type) { z-index: 2 }` instead, putting it level with the overlay
 * items and, as the last child of the Overlay fragment, in front of all of them.
 *
 * That is a CSS SPECIFICITY trap and not a source-order one, which is why this measures the computed
 * value rather than reading the stylesheet: `:not()` carries the specificity of its argument, so the
 * overlay-item rule is (0,2,1) and a plain `& > .subtitles` is (0,2,0) and loses however late it
 * comes. Writing the layer's own rule as `& > div.subtitles` ties at (0,2,1), and second place in the
 * same block then wins.
 *
 * The failure is silent and looks like nothing until a file puts a sign at the top of the frame or
 * the player shows an error behind a line of dialogue, so it gets a test rather than a comment.
