/**
 * Who owns the subtitle canvas, and what happens when the pipeline is rebuilt on the same player.
 *
 * jassub 2 takes the canvas over completely. The constructor calls `transferControlToOffscreen()`,
 * which an element accepts exactly ONCE for its whole life and throws `InvalidStateError` on the
 * second attempt (measured on Chrome 152 and Firefox 154), and `destroy()` calls `canvas.remove()`
 * unconditionally, where jassub 1 only ever removed a wrapper it had created itself.
 *
 * Both of those land on a player that rebuilds its pipeline IN PLACE: `use-playback` re-runs its
 * effect whenever the audio track changes or the element recovers from a decoder wedge, and
 * `element-recovery.browser.test.tsx` forces four of those on one mount. Handing the same element
 * over twice throws inside `bootJassub`, inside `pushFragments`, inside `startPlayback`'s try, so a
 * routine audio track change would fail the whole file with "playback failed" rather than merely
 * losing subtitles.
 *
 * So the renderer owns a canvas per jassub instance and React owns only the container. These are the
 * two properties that makes that safe, and neither is observable anywhere else in the suite.
