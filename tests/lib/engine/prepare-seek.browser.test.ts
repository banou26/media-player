/**
 * Data first, then the playhead.
 *
 * Firefox wedges its own decoder when the element demuxes into a hole: the underrun requests a
 * drain, the drain completes, the re-prime that would flush the decoder never runs, and every packet
 * after that comes back `avcodec_send_packet error: End of file`. Measured on a standalone rig
 * against a real stream, seeking the ordinary way wedged 7 times in 7, and seeking only once the
 * target had data wedged 0 in 4, with a control proving it was the data and not the added delay.
 *
 * So what is pinned here is the ORDER: `prepareSeek` puts the target's data in place and leaves the
 * playhead alone. Whether firefox then wedges is not something a test can assert, and this file does
 * not pretend to.
