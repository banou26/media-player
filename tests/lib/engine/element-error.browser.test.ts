/**
 * The element's own error is the only place the real reason lives.
 *
 * `MediaError` is terminal: the element never plays again. The pipeline used to keep pumping into it
 * anyway, and every append after that point throws `InvalidStateError: The HTMLMediaElement.error
 * attribute is not null`. `updateSourceBuffer`'s chain is built to survive a rejection, so that
 * repeated forever, and `flushPending` swallows four attempts and rethrows the fifth. What reached
 * the viewer was the FIFTH `InvalidStateError`, and the decode failure that actually killed playback
 * appeared nowhere at all. That cost a whole session of looking in the wrong place.
 *
 * `playback.ts` now listens for `error` on the element, forwards `videoElement.error`, and stops the
 * pump. This pins the behaviour that fix depends on: the event fires, and the reason is readable from
 * inside the handler.
