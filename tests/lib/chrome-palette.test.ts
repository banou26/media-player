/**
 * No control in the chrome says what it is doing with a colour alone.
 *
 * There used to be one accent, `#6EA8FE`, and one rule spending it: every `aria-pressed` button in
 * the control bar drew its glyph in blue. For mute, subtitles and full screen that was pure
 * redundancy, because the same expression that sets `aria-pressed` also picks the glyph, so the icon
 * already carried the state. For the burn-in control it was not: its glyph was fixed and the colour
 * was the whole indication, which is why removing the rule needed a second glyph rather than just a
 * deletion.
 *
 * Kept as a guard because the failure is invisible in review. Re-adding a colour-only state reads as
 * a one line improvement, and nothing on screen says that the control it applies to has no other way
 * to show what it is doing.
