/**
 * The chrome must not depend on the host page's root font.
 *
 * `rem` is root relative, so a library sized in it silently renders at whatever scale the embedding
 * app happens to use: the old contract asked hosts for `html { font-size: 62.5% }`, which made every
 * control 1.6x too large in any app that did not set it, and which an app whose own screens are sized
 * against the default root cannot set at all. Everything is sized against `--mp-unit` instead. This
 * catches a `rem` creeping back in, which would look fine in the demo (it sets 62.5%) and wrong
 * everywhere else, so a person reviewing the diff would have no reason to notice.
