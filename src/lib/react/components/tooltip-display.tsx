   * Close on a fullscreen transition, unless the pointer really is still on the anchor.
   *
   * Going fullscreen relays the whole chrome out from under a pointer that never moved, and the
   * browser recomputes the hover chain for that SILENTLY: the :hover flag flips a frame later, so
   * the grey pill corrects itself in about 14ms, but no boundary event is dispatched at all.
   * react-tooltip closes on mouseout and on nothing else, so it never learns the pointer left and
   * the chip stays painted for the rest of the session. It survives arbitrary pointer movement,
   * because the browser has already updated its own element-under-pointer, and it survives the
   * chrome's auto-hide, coming back the moment the controls wake.
   *
   * Scoped to the fullscreen transition on purpose: the same layout move made by ordinary CSS does
   * dispatch mouseout and closes the chip by itself, so no other reflow needs this and widening it
   * would only add ways to close a tooltip that should be open.
   *
   * Tested against the anchor's rect rather than closed outright, because a player that already
   * fills the window moves nothing, and the tooltip under the pointer is then legitimately open.
   * That is the same test chrome.tsx's onMouseOut makes when relatedTarget comes back null. The rect
   * is already the post-transition one when fullscreenchange fires, where matches(':hover') is not,
   * which is why the pointer is tracked rather than asked for.
   *
   * A host that keeps the fullscreen fullscreens an element of its own document, so a player in a
   * frame hears no fullscreenchange (measured 2026-10-26, Chromium) and the chip stayed through any
   * later pointer move. Its window resizes with the frame, after the move, so that is what this
   * listens to then. The host's `active` would not do: across origins it comes by a message, and no
   * rule orders a message against the frame's new size.
